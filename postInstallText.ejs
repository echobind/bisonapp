All set! To finalize setup, do the following:

cd <%= name %>

* Setup your database with \`yarn db:setup\`. You will be prompted to create it if necessary.
* Run the app with \`yarn dev\`. This will start the dev server and watchers for generating types.
* Create a new GitHub repo, and push the code from your newly generated app.
* Set ENV vars for CI and Deployment
